# Compile time instrumentation

- handle memory accessing instructions: Alloca: insert code to call
Asan runtime function to store mapping information(address, size)

- Load: insert code to replace high level address with low level
address insert code to allocate new memory block with the same size,
and insert code to copy the content to the new memory(shuffling,
overhead might be a concern) insert code to call runtime function to
update mapping information

# Runtime Libraries

- 1. malloc wrapper function (replaces system malloc() function,
similar with asan_malloc_linux.cc): the new malloc function stores
mapping informationa and returns high-level addr;

- 2. allocation hooking(similar with asan_allocator.cc):
